# Diabetes Predictor
The Diabetes Predictor is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters. The system leverages medical datasets (such as the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset) and applies classification algorithms to analyze features like age, BMI, glucose level, insulin,etc.

# Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, and feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
- Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Simple interface for predictions (via notebook or Flask/Django for deployment)

# Technologies Used

_Python Libraries:_ NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

_Tools:_ Jupyter Notebook

_Dataset:_ PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (from Kaggle / UCI repository)

# Installation & Usage
_Run the Jupyter Notebook:_

jupyter notebook Diabetes_Predictor.ipynb

# Objective
To provide a simple machine learning-based tool for early diabetes risk detection, enabling individuals and healthcare professionals to take preventive measures.

# Future Enhancement
- Deploy as a web/mobile app for real-time predictions
- Integrate larger and more diverse medical datasets
- Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy
- Add visualization dashboards for better interpretability
