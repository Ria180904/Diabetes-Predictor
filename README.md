# Diabetes-Predictor
The Diabetes Predictor is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters. The system leverages medical datasets (such as the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset) and applies classification algorithms to analyze features like age, BMI, glucose level, insulin,etc.
