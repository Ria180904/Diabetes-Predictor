# Diabetes-Predictor
The Diabetes Predictor is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters. The system leverages medical datasets (such as the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset) and applies classification algorithms to analyze features like age, BMI, glucose level, insulin,etc.

# Features
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, and feature scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Simple interface for predictions (via notebook or Flask/Django for deployment)

# Technologies Used

Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Dataset: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (from Kaggle / UCI repository)
